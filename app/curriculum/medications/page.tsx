              Understanding medications is crucial for older adults to maintain their health and prevent complications.
              This section provides information about common medications, potential side effects, and strategies for
              medication management.
            </p>

            <h2>Medication Management</h2>
            <p>
              As we age, managing multiple medications becomes increasingly important. Polypharmacy (taking multiple
              medications) is common among older adults and can lead to adverse drug events if not properly managed.
