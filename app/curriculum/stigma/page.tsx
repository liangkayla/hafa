            <p>
              Stigma surrounding aging and age-related health conditions can significantly impact the quality of life
              and healthcare access for older adults. At HAFA, we're committed to reducing this stigma through education
              and awareness.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Aging always leads to cognitive decline</li>
              <li>Older adults cannot learn new skills</li>
              <li>Depression is a normal part of aging</li>
              <li>Physical limitations are inevitable and untreatable</li>

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Through community education, media campaigns, and intergenerational programs, we work to challenge these
              misconceptions and promote a more accurate and positive view of aging.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our curriculum materials are designed to be accessible and engaging, providing factual information about
              aging while highlighting the continued contributions, capabilities, and value of older adults in our
              communities.
